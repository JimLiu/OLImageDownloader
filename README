How To Use
----------

### Using blocks

With blocks, you can be notified about the image download progress and whenever the image retrival
has completed with success or not:

```objective-c
#import "OLImageDownloader.h"

@interface ActivityVideoCell ()
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIImage *avatarImage;
@property (nonatomic, strong) OLImageOperationHandler *avatarImageOperation;

@end


- (void)downloadAvatarImage {
    if (!_avatarImageOperation) {
        NSURL *imageUrl = [NSURL URLWithString:self.layout.activity.user.avatarUrl];
        OLImageDownloader *downloader = [OLImageDownloader shared];
        _avatarImageOperation = [downloader downloadImageWithURL:imageUrl
                                  completed:^(UIImage *image, NSData *data, NSError *error, BOOL finished)
        {
            if (image)
            {
                self.avatarImage = image;
                [self setNeedsDisplay];
            }
            if (finished) {
                _avatarImageOperation = nil;
            }
        }];
    }
}

```

Note: neither your success nor failure block will be call if your image request is canceled before completion.
